            <!-- <p>Words are unique building blocks to our society because they are universally referenced, but individually defined. Their change is difficult to restrict. They exist within numerous contexts, and shift meanings within each one.</p> -->

<p>Words are changing in response to our changing minds. They are the Legos of our language, ones which we can reconstruct, multiply, or remove. When I think about the times I have reconstructed my mind, I remember small conversations, leaps of faith, and periods of shame that interrupted my thought processes.</p>

<p>Over time, those interruptions pushed my definitions to fall apart and rebuild, showing me the tools to build relationships, navigate difficult feelings, and form political beliefs beyond the worldview I was raised with.</p>

<p>Here are a few words, my changed definitions, and the experiences that catalyzed those changes, and redefined my worldview: </p>

                    <li>They are universally referenced, but individually defined.</li>
                    <li>Their change is difficult to restrict. It can come at a political level, through a Tiktok, from a social movement.</li>
                    <li>They exist within numerous contexts, and shift meanings within each one.</li>

Over time, those interruptions pushed those Legos to fall apart and rebuild, giving me the tools to build relationships, navigate difficult feelings, and form political beliefs beyond the worldview I was raised with.
Here are a few words, my changed definitions of them, and the experiences that catalyzed those changes, and allowed me to rebuild by reforming pieces I already have: </p> -->

        <p style="color: white;">Our definitions can hinder us way before a system ever does.  But reaching for our experiences, the ones that make us uncomfortable, the ones that warrant a pen and a paper and honest thought and watching those experiences boomerang and expand our definitions is a start to creating a better future. <br>What words have defined you? <br>What are your definitions now, and what are our definitions becoming? <br>How can you reconstruct those definitions, reclaim them, in service of a world that you want to see, that you choose to live in?</p>
